# Data Warehouse SQL End-to-End E.T.L.

This project presents a complete data warehouse solution, integrating CRM and ERP data into a structured, multi-layer (Bronze, Silver, Gold) ETL pipeline. Using SQL, we design and build data models including star schemas to support high-quality business reporting. Final datasets are visualized with Tableau dashboards, offering actionable insights and clear business value.

## Project Features:

üíæ Data architecture and layer design (Bronze, Silver, Gold).
‚öôÔ∏è SQL-based ETL pipelines: data extraction, transformation, loading.
üîó Integration of CRM and ERP data sources.
üìä Star schema and dimensional modeling.
üìà Tableau dashboard visualizations for business insights.

## Technologies Used:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
